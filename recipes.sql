420	Crust, pie, 13 - 2 crust pies	YIELD:  100 Portions (13-2 Crust Pies)\nPAN SIZE:  9-inch Pie\n\nMETHOD:\n\nSTEP 1:\nSift together flour and salt into mixer bowl.\nSTEP 2:\nAdd shortening to dry ingredients.  Using pastry knife attachment, mix at low speed 30 seconds or until shortening is evenly distributed and mixture is granular in appearance.\nSTEP 3:\nAdd cold water (40°F. to 50°F.); mix at low speed 1 minute until dough is just formed.\nSTEP 4:\nChill dough at least 1 hour for ease in handling.\nSTEP 5 - MAKING TWO-CRUST PIES:\n1.  PREPARE AND DIVIDE DOUGH:  Prepare one recipe of Pie Crust for 2-Crust Pies.  Divide dough into 13 - 7½ oz pieces for bottom crust and 13 - 7 oz pieces for top crust; place on lightly floured board.\n2.  ROLL DOUGH:  Sprinkle each piece of dough lightly with flour; flatten gently.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll lightly with quick strokes from center out to edge in all directions.  Form a circle 1 inch larger than pie pan and about 1/8 inch thick.  Bottom crust will be slightly thicker.  Shift or turn dough occasionally to prevent sticking.  If edges split, pinch cracks together.\n3.  BOTTON CRUST:  Fold rolled dough in half; carefully place into ungreased pie pan with fold at center.  Unfold and fit carefully into pie pan, being careful not to leave any air spaces between pan and dough.\n4.  FULL CRUST:  Fill as specified on idividual recipe card.\n5.  TOP CRUST:  Roll top crust in same manner as bottom crust.  Fold in half; with knife, make several small slits near center fold to allow steam to escape during baking.  Brush\nouter rim of bottom crust with water.  Lay top crust over filling with fold at center; unfold and press edges of two crusts together lightly.\n6.  REMOVE EXCESS DOUGH:  Trim overhanging edges of dough by using a knife or spatula.  (Incorporate excess dough into next crust, if needed.)  There should be little excess if skill is used in weighing and rolling dough.\n7.  SEAL PIE:  Press edges of crust firmly together or crimp with the thumb and forefinger to make a fluted edge.\n8.  WASHED TOP:  For a washed top, brush pies with appropriate wash as follows:\n     -Egg and Milk Wash- This wash is used for fruit pies    (apple,  blueberry, cherry, peach, pineapple) that are baked 30 to 35 minutes.  It SHOULD NOT be used for pies requiring longer baking time as the crust will brown excessively.  See Recipe No. I-4.\n      -Egg and Water Wash- This wash is used for berry and mincemeat pies that are baked 40 to 45 minutes.  It SHOULD NOT be used for pies that are baked 30 to 35 minutes as the crusts will be too pale.  Allow glaze to dry on crust before baking to eliminate dark spots.  See Recipe No. I-4-1.\n9.  BAKE:  Bake as specified on individual recipe card.\n\nNOTE:\nPie crust mix may be used.  Omit Steps 1 through 3.  Follow manufacturer's directions for preparation.  Follow Steps 4 and 5.

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF STEAM COOKERS:  \n\nUse of steamers in quantity food preparation can save cooking time, labor, help maintain appearance of food, and preseve nutrients normally lost by other cooking methods.  Seamers are ideal for batch preparation.  Food may be steamed and served in the same pan, if steam table pans are used for preparation.\n\nSteamers are either 5 lb pressure or 15 lb pressure (high speed) type.  When food is steamed at 5 lb pressure, the internal temperature of the steamer is 225°F. to 228°F.  At 15 lb pressure, the temperature is 245°F. to 250°F.\n\nMost fresh or frozen vegetables, in additoin to other foods such as rice, pasta, poultry, meats, fish, and shellfish can be cooked in steamers.  Canned vegetables also can be quickly heated in steamers.  \n\nFoods may be steamed in perforated or solid pans.  Perforated pans are usually used, particularly for vegetables, unless the cooking liquid is retained or manufacturer's directions specify solid type pans.  Pans are normally filled no more than 2/3 full to allow steam to circulate for even cooking.\n\nCooking times will vary depending on the type steamer, food, and temperature and quantity of the product.  For best results follow the manufacturer's cooking times and directions.  Cooking time should be scheduled to include bringing food up to cooking temperature, as well as steaming time.  TIMING BEGINS when the pressure gauge registers 3 lb on the 5 lb steamer and 9 lb on the 15 lb steamer.  Be sure to USE TIMER, IF AVAILABLE, TO PREVENT OVERCOOKING.\n\nAfter cooking is completed, the steam should be exhausted slowly for safety and to preserve skins of vegetables such as peas.  Leave steamer doors ajar for cooling and to preserve door gaskets.\n\n2.  Two No.10 scoops may be used.	2023-10-13 13:40:40.780786	2023-10-13 13:40:40.780786
